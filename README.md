# Django Training Project

## Description

Django is a popular framework written in python to implement backend servers, responsible for backend logic such as interaction with databases and business logic. On top of that, Django as with many other python frameworks, come with a 'batteries included mentality', which includes templating and view that allow the user to setup a simple functional website without using any frontend languages.

This project is a student management portal where the admin can easily see student's information listed, and perform CRUD operations on a separate postgresql database.
This project was created to test and apply some of these Django concepts, such as models for interacting with databases, views for displaying the page, templating for formatting the html using Django templating engine.

Vue.js was chosen as the frontend language due to its simplicity and ease of usage compared to other frameworks like React or Angular.
